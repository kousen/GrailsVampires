GrailsVampires
==============

RESTful Grails app serving Rotten Tomatoes movies for Gr8conf.us 2014

Revised for SpringOne2GX 2014.

This app replaces the Hibernate plugin with MongoDB, allowing you to do GORM methods on mapped classes.
The domain model is based on the JSON response objects from Rotten Tomatoes (http://developer.rottentomatoes.com).
